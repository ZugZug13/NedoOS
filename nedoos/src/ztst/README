A collection of different Z80 tests ported to NedoOS.


=================
= ZEXDOC/ZEXALL =
=================

zexdoc tests documented flags.
zexall also includes undocumented ones.

Working time is about 50 billions of standard Z80 clock cycles.
For best results, redirect program output to file like this:

zexall >log.txt


zexdoc and zexall tests are known to pass on Z84C0020 (cmos), Z0840008 (nmos), libZ80 by ZJoyKiler (redcode on github) and Unreal Speccy 0.39.0

When these tests pass, all lines of their output are OK and there should be no CRC mismatches.

============

there's plenty of tests:
z80ccf.com
z80doc.com
z80docflags.com
z80flags.com
z80full.com
z80memptr.com

Among them, z80doc and z80docflags should pass except for probably any IN* insns.
The latter require port FF to always read FF and port FE to always read BF. The tests check that and do not report 'failed CRC' if it is not the case.

All other tests test different undoc features of Z80.
