       Reviews: IF Competition 2001              Andrew PlotkinPeople have already started saying thatit's a weak year, and I think I agree. So-me people are saying it's an awful year,and I don't agree with that. Fewer gamesthan usual made me stand up and say "Yes!I'm really enjoying this!" But that's askew, not a total failure of quality. Lookat the ranges: I rated 36% of the games (9out of 25) in the top half of my personalrating scale. Last year, that was 48%.This is a drop, but it's not the end of IFas we know it. (Two years ago was a weakyear, too.) I didn't give out a 10 thisyear. I did give three 9s; none of themshone quite as brightly as I expect from a10. This does not, of course, mean theywere failures.            Other comments...  I got started late, and only played halfthe games. Oops. As usual, I bent the ru-les slightly by glancing at the firstscreen of each game in advance, before de-ciding what to play. Now, I started outwith a "play one long game and one shortgame every day" plan, but I took too manydays off to finish the course. So my listof completed games is not a random selec-tion; it's influenced by how well the ope-ning text pulled me in. I don't thinkthat's particularly unfair. Even if it is,it's only one source of influence; I also(as usual) avoided Windows-only games. Iplay what I play.  My "reviews" continue in theshort-and-random vein. (Potentially embar-rassing, as I wrote three intensely longand detailed reviews of Playstation gamesduring the IFComp period... but hey: Iplay what I play.) Conversation menus. Se-veral games used this. I continue to findthe effect weak. I said this last year,too, and repeated exposure is not makingme any happier with the device.  Glulx (and, generally, multimedia IFsystems) seem to have inspired a wide ran-ge of responses. Some authors are writinggames whose sole point is to demo multime-dia features; some are integrating grap-hics and gameplay; some are taking advan-tage of one or two carefully-selected fea-tures, such as multiple windows, hyper-links, or background music. I think thisis healthy. We will continue to see a wi-der range of experiment in upcoming IFworks.  Enough of that. Here are the scores,from highest to lowest. (I've added plusesand minuses in the interest of furtherdiscrimination, although of course onlythe plain integers counted in official vo-ting.)  9+: All Roads   9 : Prized Possession   9-: Fusillade   8 : The Gostak   8-: Vicious Cycles   8-: Elements   7+: Journey from an Islet   7 : Best of Three   6 : Grayscale  5 : Bane of the Builders   5 : Earth And Sky   5-: an apple from nowhere   4+: Fine Tuned   4 : Carma   4 : Stick it to the man   3+: The Evil Sorcerer   3-: Volcano Isle   2+: Stiffy Makane: The Undiscovered Country   2 : The Cruise   2-: Jump   1+: You Are Here   1+: Silicon Castles   1 : A Night Guest   1 : Schroedinger's Cat   1-: The Newcomer   And the comments, in the order that Iplayed the games. (Foot, er, headnote: Idid not know the true identity of any ofthe pseudonymous entrants, except for AdamThornton. In case you care. And althoughAdam kindly lists me in the credits of"Stiffy Makane", I really didn't do anymore beta-testing than to start up the ga-me and see if the opening credits workedright.)Schroedinger's CatJames WillsonOkay, things are there only some of thetime. I do not get the rule that governsthis, but since the "about" text says the-re is nothing else in the game, I am notmotivated to work it out.Earth and Sky"Lee Kirby" (Paul O'Brian)Cute, but only a first chapter. The author provides three different con-versational systems (pre-scripted conver-sation, ask/tell about, and menu). Thismakes it very clear that menus are my le-ast favorite. Yes, really, it breaks mysense of immersion more when the gameprints out six different possibilities formy line, than when the game prints six al-ternating lines of a dialogue (without gi-ving me any choices at all). I wound upalways choosing "say nothing" followed by"talk to character", to get that dialogue-- but I wish there was an option to makethe menus not appear at all.  Somehow the introduction left me expec-ting a more hard-science game. When thesuperpowers showed up, I had a bit of men-tal whiplash, and the insta-beast didn'thelp.  The initial sequence, when you're expe-rimenting with your powers and tryingthings, with Austin prompting you -- a lotof work went into that. It reacts nicelyto anything you try, and what you try af-fects the rest of the sequence. Nitpick:gigawatt is a measure of energy flow rate,and is pretty much meaningless for a ligh-tning bolt.The GostakCarl Muckenhoupt  Also cute. And the idea sort of works --except that I'm pretty sure you can't fi-nish the game without looking at thehints. (I couldn't actually finish the ga-me at all. Can't figure out how to skobethe shamtag.)  Now, this doesn't invalidate the idea.Instead of playing a game that you don'tunderstand (and learning about it in theprocess), you're performing the activityof playing a game and looking at hints,none of which you understand. (But you'relearning about it in that process.) It's aslightly different joke. But a slightlyless cool one.  Still pretty cool, though. I did, infact, understand a lot of it. (I got thein-joke references to Nethack directions,Smullyan yes/no words, and of course thetitle. Any others will have to be explai-ned to me.)Vicious CyclesSimon Mark  I dunno. The story is well-imagined, butit leaves a bad taste in my mouth. Thewhole thing seems slightly thin. I woundup looking at the walkthrough twice -Ifelt like I had literally tried everythingpossible with the very small range of ac-tion available. (In fact, of course, Ihadn't, but that's the feeling I had.)  Severe guess-the-noun problem with "askEthan about *". Lot more synonyms neededthere.  "You know what to do" is rather a pain-ful cliche at this point.The NewcomerJason Love  Not finished. Gosh, I guess that expla-ins why the game file is so short.GrayscaleDaniel T. Freas  I didn't feel like I was given much of agoal, nor any plot along the way. if thisis a walk through the ocean of the aut-hor's soul, about all I've learned is thatI can't read his poetry. (I can't readmost poetry.) Good eye for scenery.  Most of the puzzles... weren't solvable.By which I don't mean they were impossib-le, or even hard. I mean that, if I lackedthe solution, I wasn't given anything thatwould lead me in the right direction. Andif I had a solution without a puzzle, Iwasn't given anything that led me in thatdirection either. A general lack of direc-tion, is what I'm trying to get across he-re... Spelling and grammar are somewhatweak. (It's easy to misspell "fluorine",but to blow that and "iodine" both in thesame sentence is a winner. :) Some doorsopen automatically when you move throughthem; some don't. And it's not always loc-ked doors that stay closed and unlockeddoors that open. I typed "unlock frenchdoor" while holding the key, and it said"You can't reach the lock from this sideof the glass." Later I broke the glass andthen typed "unlock french door with key",and it said "The key doesn't seem to fitthe lock." So I gave up. Turned out thatjust "unlock french door" would have wor-ked at that point. This was extremely mis-leading.  The game says it's impossible to get in-to an unwinnable state, but that's notmuch comfort when you put on a mask, can'ttake it off, and die a few turns later.There may be a way to get rid of it, butif the player doesn't know how, it is anunwinnable state for that player, with allthe attendant negative consequences.(I.e., if the player hasn't saved, he'sscrewed.) For some reason, I really likethe fact that if you wander into the pineforest, you come out somewhere randomly.Maybe it's just the Zorkness of it all."get bars" hangs the game.Silicon Castles"Jack Maet" (David Given)Impressive as a Z-machine abuse. Not IF.  One IF-relevant note: the opening screenhas a timed delay. You can't interrupt thedelay. This annoyed me. (Yes, I was lite-rally pounding the space bar trying to getthe game to respond.)Journey from an IsletMario Becroft  More of an exercise than a game... well,more of an exercise than a story.  Definitely a game.  Heavy on the description, which worksreasonably well. Sense of wonder, but so-mewhat on the artificial side. Light onthe plot, and I seem to be into plot thisyear, so I wasn't all that excited. "Plea-sant diversion", is what comes to mind.  (Do the pipes have eight notes or se-ven?)The CruiseNorman Perlmutter  Ack! Huge infodump!  (Huge infodump with "Okay, you're nowsitting on the barstool" tacked onto theend! Suppress that, please.)  This is all awkwardly phrased and hardto take seriously. I feel like the authorhas a good sense of what's going on, andwhat he wants to communicate, but it justdoesn't come across well.  Oh, I notice that if you ask the man torepeat his infodump, he also repeats theactions of giving you a detector andspraying stuff in your eyes. Editing nee-ded. The "powerful magnets occupy[ing] thebow and stern" were worth a chuckle. Po-ints for a creative solution to theship-orientation problem... And "It deri-ves its power from the force of orange-ness" got a laugh, also. For the hundredthtime, if you must ask a yes/no questionthat doesn't go through the standard com-mand parser, use a different input prompt.Okay, now I've got an "x" appearing everyturn. That can't be a good sign. The hintssay "You do have enough money for the timebeing", but I don't. I give up. (It's onlya last point anyway.)Prized PossessionKathleen M. Fischer  Oh, good. Short and highly scripted -- asequence of very short scenes -- but enga-ging. Characters, background, descriptionall solid. The plot seemed somewhat vague.I don't think I ever caught all of whatwas going on, even after seeing multiplepaths and endings; the scenes were indivi-dually strong, but I was dragged from oneto the next without enough sense of con-nection.  I often felt like I had just one or twooptions available. Sometimes this was ingeneral action and sometimes the conversa-tion menus, but it actually felt about thesame either way. This game did not throwme out of the narrative with its conversa-tion menus; I much prefer this sort ofbrief, abstract topic list to the morecommon list of complete sentences.  Nonetheless, the whole game did feel abit like a CYOA game. This is just my sen-se of humor talking, but I would have pre-ferred if, even if you end up marrying whoyou want to marry, you still wind up pum-ping out babies like a Krispy Kreme dough-nut machine.  Typo in the second sentence ("check").Sigh.Volcano IslePaul DeWitt  When I started playing I immediately sa-id, "Oh my, it's a Scott Adams adventure!"  A few turns later, rather less amused, Isaid "Oh, it's Zork."  It's definitely old-fashioned, and notparticularly well-written. The design ofthe game is functional, but it's got not-hing in particular to attract the attenti-on.  "get in boat" really should be a synonymfor "enter boat".You Are HereRoy Fisher  This seeks to emulate a bad fantasy MUD,full of stereotypical mudders. I would sayit succeeds.  Some of this is pretty clever, but notenough, and it doesn't do anything withwhat it's got. Apparently I'm supposed tocare about this because of a play someoneis performing in Canada somewhere, butthis is the IF competition, so I don't.When I got stuck, I stopped playing.All RoadsJon Ingold  I am well and fully pleased. This throwsa handful of confusion into the air, letsyou pluck a few grains out, and watchesthe rest bounce into the cracks betweenthe cobblestones -- but you have just eno-ugh to come out the other side.  Venice in that era is still terribly,terribly cool.  (How can a three-legged stool rock?)The Evil SorcererGren Remoz  A bit of nostalgia for Classic AdventureGaming -- brightly-colored locations, exp-licit plot-token hunting, random mixturesof modern and generic-fantasy elements. Ienjoy that stuff more than you might thinkfrom reading these comments. However, thewriting is clunky and the game doesn't co-me off. Game-logic sometimes becomes ab-surd. When Julia says you need a particu-lar item, and she doesn't seem to noticeit is there in the room with you, the sen-se of disbelief becomes strained.  Inventory limit -- annoying and point-less.  Getting the rusty key is a terrible gu-ess-the-verb problem. Should have about adozen more synonyms. I'd say even "getkey" should work, if you're holding theappropriate item.Fine-Tuned"Dionysius Porcupine" (Dennis Jerz)  This game has a terrific sense of at-mosphere and prose, a medium-good sense ofplot, a weak sense of pacing, and a lousysense of actually being finished. I reallyenjoyed the absurdly floofy first chapter.The second chapter didn't seem to havemuch to do with the first, and I didn'tgain much confidence that it would hangtogether at all. The storyline does cometogether more after that, but it goes in anumber of different absurd directions, andI wasn't quite convinced.  Unfortunately the last bits were full ofunpatched seams -- the game may work rightif you stay on the intended rails, but assoon as you try to do anything else, youget inappropriate daemon messages, skippedsegments of narration, and crashes.  Even the walkthrough is buggy, for hea-vens' sake. I managed to get nearly to theend, but the last move is either unobviousor broken, so I didn't see the ending.  Nonetheless, the game has good writingand a solid sense of what it's supposed tobe, which is worth a lot.  The conversational responses don't trackgame events very well. You can ask a cha-racter about something before he tells youabout it, and the resulting text doesn'tmake sense. (Try "ask aloysius aboutstranger" too soon, for example.)  (Debug mode left on in competition rele-ase.)ElementsJohn Evans  You start this game with a bathing suit,one sock, a keyring, and (optionally) atattoo. I have nothing to say about thataspect of the game, but it does remind meof a conversation I had several years ago:Housemate: "And they came out on stage we-aring nothing but fedoras and socks." Me:"Hm. Well, that could actually cover quitea bit, depending on where you wear the fe-dora."  Housemate: "...or the sock."  Sorry. Back to the game. I started itup, looked at the initial layout, read theabout text -- a classic case of "Informlearning experience expanded into compentry". Oh no. Then I started wanderingaround a bit, and realized I was enjoyingthe damn thing.  I bounced around and messed with toysfor nearly the full two hours. I wound uplooking at the hints frequently; too manyof the puzzles were unmotivated or underc-lued. (Plus, a few bugs.) But it was stillfun.  Needs more synonyms and responses. "to-uch fire" : "You feel nothing unexpected."The author says to examine the scenery,but far too many scenery objects areunimplemented -- this is such a spare en-vironment (and intended for exploration)that everything should be examinable, evenif it just gets a "not important".  (Generally needs much more beta-tes-ting.)  Nope, I still don't like conversationmenus.FusilladeMike Duncan  Well-named. Each bit is well-written,but I wish they all hung together better.The few scraps of continuity, reprises ofone scene's background in another, work somuch better than the one-shots. I wish thegame had had a lot more of that.  As it stood, I was reacting to each sce-ne on its own. Some I liked, some Ididn't. But I didn't feel like much wasbuilding up over the full course of thegame. So I had no reason to care about thescenes that didn't grab me. The responseto "inventory" is "Sorry for all you packrats out there, but there is no inventorycommand in this game - and neither is oneneeded." Okay, but "examine me" gave me aninventory listing; it's ingenuous to pre-tend you can't do it. Since the game-helpspecifically recommends "x me" as a way toget oriented, perhaps "i" should map tothe same command.  (Having finished the game, I still thinkthis is a good idea. It would fit in justabout every scene. "Look" and "inventory"are reflexive commands; when they don'twork, I feel paralyzed, which is distrac-ting.)  The status line always has "/n/t" appen-ded. I don't know if this is a bug in thegame or the TADS 2.5.4 engine -- it couldbe the MaxTADS shell, but I don't thinkso.  Sheesh, if the text refers to "the longcold thing", I should be able to type"examine long cold thing". Generally doesn't give enough credence tostandard IF commands, even when they'reappropriate. In one scene the game sug-gests resting, but "wait" is not a synonymfor "rest". More attention to synonyms,when variant terms are used in the text --"mines" for "mine", for example.JumpChris Mudd  The story tries to be about extremes ofemotion, but it doesn't involve me. Neit-her the writing nor the interaction pullsme in; I don't know enough, I'm just shownthese people.A Night Guest"Dr. Inkalot" (Valentine Kopteltsev)  Er, well, I guess. The poetry is no goodand the game is a sequence of gu-ess-the-next-line puzzles. (If you had torhyme, that would be clever, but no.)  Extremely short, and not interesting.Stiffy Makane: The Undiscovered Country"One of The Bruces" (Adam Thornton)  So this game is deliberately crude, stu-pid, and offensive to very nearly everybo-dy.  It is funny in places, however. It isnot particularly erotic. For which I thankall the gods.an apple from nowhere"steven carbone" (Brendan Barnwell)  (For no particular reason, I'm writingthese comments as I play, instead of whenI'm done.)  First-person, sigh -- although I guessthe author is trying to write in a stylethat sticks out; not just first-person,but all lower-case.  (I don't know what the heck's going onhere.)  Okay, the author is definitely playingwith prose styles here. However, now it'sover and I still don't know what theheck's going on. We've definitely got ent-husiasm, and the car chase is a greatset-piece, but I'd like it to be in aid ofsomething.Bane of the BuildersBogdan Baliuc  I always like an exploring-alien-planettheme, but this is pretty minor. The pro-tagonist doesn't seem to react to his en-vironment at all -- not even to, as he be-lieves, live aliens -- and it's hard toget excited. Nice idea for changing envi-ronment.  By the middle of the game, I'm playing"guess the author's intent" and "guess theverb", which is doubly disappointing. Al-so, a boring maze. Very weak on implemen-tation of commands. "Set blaster" not onlyfails, it doesn't give you any clue that"set blaster to stun" will work.Best of ThreeEmily Short"Grant Stern"?!  This is signed, so I guess I can compareit to Galatea... The conversational web isstill an impressive device, but I am (asusual) less interested in anything thatdoesn't have a sci-fi/fantasy edge. I mes-sed around with the dialogue for aboutfifteen minutes, and then had a suddenspasm of You're-All-Just-A-Pack-Of-Cardsand typed "topic sex" just to see what wo-uld happen.  I identified enough with the characterthat I was (mostly) steering the conversa-tion by my own impulses. I was uncomfor-table saying anything that I wouldn't sayin real life; and the engine was willingto accommodate me, which means that it'sprobably very flexible in letting theplayer shape the conversation.  On the other hand, I identified enoughwith the character that I resented beingdrawn into this conversation which, infact, doesn't resemble anything that actu-ally happens to me.  Conclusion: well-written, but not in aidof anything that really interests me. (Fo-otnote: I spent half an hour trying todredge up the name of, you know, that statue game that Emily Short wrote,starts with a "G"... Totally blanked. Theonly answer that was materializing was Gi-aconda -- and that was clearly leaking infrom an alternate universe. I hate whenthat happens.)  (Giaconda is probably worth playing,though.)Carma"The Wanna-be Writer" (Marnie Parker)  An interactive grammar test. Somewhatamusing; I like the art; the test at theend is nicely implemented, in a 3 in Threesort of way. However, only barely a game.Stick it to the man"H. Joshua Field" (Brendan Barnwell)  Good evocation of experience, and a lotof character and dialogue description, butafter I wandered around for a while I rea-lized I didn't have anything in particularto do. Maybe something would have come up,but I typed "x oscar" and the game hung.
