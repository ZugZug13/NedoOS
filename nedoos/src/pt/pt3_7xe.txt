"s"=sample number, "nn"=note. (General Sound plays 3 standard Amiga octaves, notes #24 to #4A.) If you use this command in channel A, it will play in GS channel A, etc. So you have 9 channels: 6 AY (TurboSound) + 3 digital.Working process:1. Prepare a MOD file with your samples.2. Put it on TRD with name "filename.i" (.mod for NedoOS version).3. Run Pro Tracker.4. Load your MOD file (nothing happens, but the samples are loaded in General Sound).5. Compose :)Note, if you haven't loaded a MOD file, General Sound will hang on 8snn command. That's because GS command "Play FX" doesn't work for non-existant sample.In positions list (order):digits - change pattern #*K - Set loop start*L - Set loop endIn Edit smp (orn) menu:*0-9 - octave*True/Inv - switch between samples (ornaments)ssU,ssI - switch between ornaments (samples)W,E - +/-1R,T - +/-32 (12)*ss8,ss9 (brackets) - regulate volume0 - annulssK - change sign*K - Set loop start (loop is magenta stripe over line numbers - you can set it by mouse)*L - Set loop end*A - regulate volume cumulation*9 - on/off tone frequency cumulation*F - on/off noise/envelope frequency cumulation*Y,U,I - on/off T-N-E masksnote keys for hear current sample with current ornamentHow to convert track (music channel) from Tempo=6 to Tempo=3:ss2, Home, Down, Ins (hold until receiving result)How to convert track from Tempo=3 to Tempo=6:ss1, Home, Down, BackSpace (hold until result)How to clear track quickly:a) if cursor is in last pattern: PgDn,ssT,PrUp,ssR¡) ss1, ssL (hold until result)Main code: Nick/GDCIdeas, code, fix, design: Mm<M/Sa9eDecompile, code, large fix: Alone Coder/i8(4732) 522-449 ‚ ¤¨¬ (JV Gfx of GDC)(4732) 141-962 ¨ª®« © (Nick of GDC)(8462) 94-15-95 ‘¥à£¥© (Mm<M) mmcm^yandex.ru(4912) 75-13-90 „¨¬  (Alone Coder) 2:5029/77.48 Dima Bystrov390026 ï§ ­ì,ã«.‚ëá®ª®¢®«ìâ­ ï ¤.37 ª.1,ª¢.12 ëáâà®¢ã „¬¨âà¨îdmitry_alonecoder^gmail.comalone_coder^mail.ruGDC Voronezh, 1997 - Sa9e Samara, 2000 - Invaders Ryazan, 2007P.S.
