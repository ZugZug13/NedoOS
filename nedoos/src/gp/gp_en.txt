gp.com - Player for AY8910, GeneralSound, NeoGS, MoonSound/BomgeMoon, TurboSound,
	MultiSound, a prototype sound card with two YM2151 chips and one YM2608
	(see below for details).

Supported formats:
 - mp3  NeoGS
 - mid  NeoGS rev.CM with VLSI VS1003/VS1033/VS1053 decoder chip,
        MIDI UART connected to AY port A.2 (e.g. MultiSound)
 - ogg  NeoGS rev.CM with VLSI VS1053/VS1063 decoder chip
 - aac  NeoGS rev.CM with VLSI VS1033/VS1053/VS1063 decoder chip
 - vgm  AY, MoonSound (chips YM3526, YM3812, YMF262, YMF278B),
	TurboSound FM (2x YM2203), YM2151, YM2608
 - vgz  same as vgm
 - mwm  MoonSound
 - pt2  AY
 - pt3  AY, TurboSound (2x AY)
 - mod  MoonSound, GeneralSound/NeoGS (via soundcard firmware)
 - s3m  MoonSound

You can turn off MoonSound .mod player if you've got both GeneralSound and 
MoonSound installed in your computer. Moreover, you can turn off all players,
which you're not using, to reduce application memory footprint. Check out the
settings in bin\gp\gp.ini file. Note that MoonSound .mod player allows changing
default panning of the channels, which may improve listening experience when
using headphones.

ZXM-MoonSound firmware

Unfortunately, the firmware 1.0 is incompatible with ZX-Evolution/baseconf.
OPL4 ports 7E and 7F are not working properly, only OPL3 ports are accessible.
It's still possible to play OPL3 .vgm files using the player, but .mwm and 
OPL4 .vgm are not going to work. You should update MoonSound to 
baseconf-compatible firmware 1.01 to enable OPL4 on baseconf

https://www.dropbox.com/s/hzcj8wbmion3d3g/zxm_moonsound01_src0101.zip
Firmware 1.01 is fully backwards compatible with 1.0.

If you're running NedoOS on a hardware other than ZX-Evolution (e.g. ATM), 
you can get OPL4 working with the firmware 1.0. You'd need to recompile the
player changing MOON_WREG = 0xc2 to MOON_WREG = 0x7e in moonsound.asm

Please set parameter value BomgeMoon=1 in the config file bin\gp\gp.ini
if you have OPL3-only sound card, such as BomgeMoon. This prevents
the player from trying to detect OPL4 ports, which are unavailable on 
your sound card.

Wavekits for MoonBlaster modules (.mwm)

Some MoonBlaster modules require wavekits, which contain custom samples.
When you're playing <FileName>.mwm module, the player will try to load
<FileName>.mwk first. If there's no such file, then the player will read 
<WaveKitName> located in .mwm file at the offset 0x114. If <WaveKitName> is 
NONE then no wavekit is needed. Otherwise, the player will try to load 
<WaveKitName>.mwk, and if there's no such file then .mwm won't be played.

VGM from arcade machines based on YMF278B

MoonSound can correctly play VGM dumps from an arcade only if all needed music
samples are located in the 1st megabyte of sound ROM *and* in the first 128
wave table entries.

NeoGS rev.CM

This player supports VLSI codecs other than MosArt MA8201A(U). Revision CM of
the PCB enables the use of a range of VLSI chips. I strongly recommend VS1053b
for the best sound quality. Production files for NeoGS rev.CM can be found here

Playing MIDI

If you can't hear music via MIDI UART connection or you only hear single
notes, you can try setting variable MidiUartDelayOverride in bin\gp\gp.ini
By default, the player selects value of UART delay automatically depending on
CPU speed, but there can be inaccuracies leading to incorrect transfer rate
different from the 31250 baud required by MIDI protocol.

VLSI codecs only support MIDI format 0 (SMF 0) because SMF 1 and SMF 2 can't
be streamed and must be preloaded entirely. The main difference between these
formats is how notes are structured. Unfortunately, this player doesn't convert
MIDI to SMF 0 automatically, so you'd have to convert MIDI files to SMF 0 
offline using GN1:0 MIDI Converter (or a similar program)

The addresses of all ports can be easily changed. The address values are defined in 
the files common\opm.asm and common\opna.asm. The code is written with the assumption
that the values can be arbitrary.
